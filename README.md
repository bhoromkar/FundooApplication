Introduction
Fundoo App is a web application that serves as a clone of Google Keep. It allows users to create, edit, organize, and manage notes. This application is built using .NET Core Web API 3.1 and follows a three-tier architecture to ensure a structured and maintainable codebase.

Features
Create, edit, and delete notes.
Organize notes with labels.
Archive and unarchive notes.
Set reminders for notes.
Collaborate with other users on shared notes.
Search notes.
Secure user authentication and authorization.
System Architecture
The application follows a three-tier architecture, consisting of the following layers:

Presentation Layer: This layer handles the user interface and interactions. It is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The frontend is built using a modern framework like Angular, React, or Vue.js.

Application Layer: The application layer contains the business logic and acts as an intermediary between the presentation and data layers. It is implemented using .NET Core Web API 3.1.

Data Layer: This layer is responsible for interacting with the database. It uses a relational database management system (RDBMS) like SQL Server or MySQL. Entity Framework Core is used for data access.
